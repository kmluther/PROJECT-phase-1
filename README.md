# PROJECT-phase-1

For my phase 1 project I will be creating a webpage using the Cocktail Database. The website will allow users to select a type of liquor from a dropdown selector. When the user selects a liquor, the site will show a list of cocktails (with photos and past user ratings) made with that liquor. From there, the user can click on the drink of their choice to reveal the recipe and instructions for making that drink. They can then submit a rating of the recipe.

User Stories:
 - As a user, I want to be able to view a list of drinks that I can make with the liquor I select.
 - As a user, I want to be able to select any of the drinks from the list to view the recipe and instructions to make it.
 - As a user, I want to be able to leave a rating of the drink I made that other users can see.
